CHALLENGE #4
Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!

Your tasks:

Create an array called bills containing all 10 test bill values.

Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals (tips and totals)

Use the calcTip function we wrote before (included in the starter code) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!



TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, and 52.



BONUS:

Write a function calcAverage which takes an array called arr as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it if you feel like it:

First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable sum that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the sum variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together.

To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements).

Call the function with the totals array.

// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!

Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game (below). In this challenge we're gonna work with the data. So here are your tasks:

1. Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and 'players2')
2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 field players
3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22 players)
4. During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player names (NOT an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of player names passed in)
7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the console which team is more likely to win, WITHOUT using an if/else statement or the ternary operator.

TEST DATA FOR 6: Use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from game.scored

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
